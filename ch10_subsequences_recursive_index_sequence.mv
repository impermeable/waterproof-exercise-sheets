## Exercise 10.7.6

```coq
Section colors.
Variable P : â„• â†’ Color.

Parameter infinitely_many_blues :
  âˆ€ K âˆˆ â„•, âˆƒ m â‰¥ K, P(m) = blue.

Lemma exercise_10_7_6 : âˆƒ n : (â„• â†’ â„•),
  (is_index_sequence n) âˆ§ (âˆ€ k âˆˆ â„•, P(n(k)) = blue).
Proof.
Define the index sequence n inductively.
