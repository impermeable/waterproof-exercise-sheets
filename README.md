# Waterproof exercise sheets

This repository contains examples of the Waterproof exercise sheets.
[Waterproof](https://github.com/impermeable/waterproof) is a custom Coq editor developed for use in mathematics education.
Students type out their proofs in Waterproof and get immediate feedback on every proof step.
Unlike with the default Coq proof assistant, proofs written in Waterproof are similar in style to proofs written with pen and paper.

These exercises are used to supplement the teaching of Analysis 1 at the [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/).
Instead of handing in their homework like normal, students can opt to hand in a completed exercise sheet.
The numbering of the exercises refers to the [lecture notes](https://www.win.tue.nl/~jwporteg/Analysis-Notes.pdf) written by the lecturer, Jim Portegies.


## Tutorial and overviews.

This repository also contains the Waterproof tutorial, `Tutorial.wpe`, which comes bundled with the Wateproof editor itself.
The tutorial is rather extensive, so we also include here two smaller notebooks that summarize its contents:

* `Tutorial-just-examples.wpe` leaves out all descriptive text from the tutorial, it only contains examples how tactics can be used to show specific goals.
_These tactics were developed specifically for Waterproof, see the [coq-waterproof](https://github.com/impermeable/coq-waterproof) library._

* `Interface-overview.wpe` summarizes the Waterproof interface and how users can interact with it.
