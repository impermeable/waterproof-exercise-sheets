# Waterproof exercise sheets

This repository contains examples of Waterproof exercise sheets.
[Waterproof](https://github.com/impermeable/waterproof-vscode) is an adaptation of the Coq  proof assistant developed for use in mathematics education.
Students type out their proofs in Waterproof and get immediate feedback on every proof step.
Unlike with the default Coq proof assistant, Waterproof comes with a custom proof language that allows proofs to be written in a style similar to handwritten proofs.

These exercises are used to supplement the teaching of Analysis 1 at the [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/).
Instead of handing in their homework like usual, students can opt to hand in a completed exercise sheet.
The numbering of the exercises refers to the [lecture notes](https://www.win.tue.nl/~jwporteg/Analysis-Notes.pdf) written by the lecturer, Jim Portegies.


## Tutorial

This repository also contains the Waterproof tutorial, `tutorial.mv`, which explains how to use Waterproof's custom proof language.

<!-- * `Tutorial-just-examples.wpe` leaves out all descriptive text from the tutorial, it only contains examples how tactics can be used to show specific goals.
_These tactics were developed specifically for Waterproof, see the [coq-waterproof](https://github.com/impermeable/coq-waterproof) library._ -->
