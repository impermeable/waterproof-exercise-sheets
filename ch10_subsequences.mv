Variable (X : Metric_Space) (a b : â„• â†’ X) (p : X).
Notation "'dist(' x , y )" := (dist X x y) (format "'dist(' x ,  y ')'").

**Intermediate exercise:** show that the sequence $n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ given by $n(k) := 2k$ is an *index sequence*.
```coq
Definition n (k : nat) := (2 * k).

Lemma n_is_index_sequence : n is an _index sequence_.
Proof.

We now show that $c(n(k)) = a(n(k))$ for all $k : \mathbb{N}$. You can use this lemma later.
```coq
Lemma c_n_k_equals_a_n_k : âˆ€ k : â„•, c(n(k)) = a(n(k)).
Proof.
Take k : â„•.
It holds that
  (c(n(k)) = if n(k) is even then a(n(k)) else b(n(k))).
It holds that (n(k) is even = true).
We conclude that (c(n(k)) = a(n(k))).
Qed.
```
Now, the exercise itself:
```coq
Lemma exercise_10_7_3 : 
  p is an _accumulation point_ of c.
Proof.
We need to show that 
  (âˆƒ k : â„• â†’ â„•, k is an index sequence âˆ§ 
     c â—¦ k converges to p).
Choose k := (n).
We show both statements.
- By (n_is_index_sequence) we conclude that 
    (k is an index sequence).
- We need to show that (c â—¦ n converges to p).
  It holds that (a converges to p).
  By prop_10_3_1 it suffices to show that 
    (c â—¦ n is a subsequence of a).
